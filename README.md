**Zoo Management System**

This project is a simple Zoo Management System implemented in Java using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It allows you to create different types of animals, add them to a zoo, list all animals, and make them produce their respective sounds.

## Project Structure

- `Animal.java`: An **abstract class** representing a generic animal. It includes common properties and methods that all animals share.
- `Lion.java`: A class representing a lion, extending the `Animal` class.
- `Elephant.java`: A class representing an elephant, extending the `Animal` class.
- `Zoo.java`: A class representing the zoo, which manages a list of animals and provides methods to add animals, list all animals, and make all animals produce sounds.
- `Main.java`: The main class to run the application.
